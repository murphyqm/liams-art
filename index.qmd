### Imagine More, 2019

**Liam**: I made this for the Credit Union Art Competition. The word imagine made me think of magic things. I drew a magic wizard, magic glasses, and a magic dragon. I used crayons, coloured pencil, and water colour.

**Mary**: We chatted about the "Imagine More" title and Liam brainstormed these ideas.

### Up, 2020

**Liam**: I really like the "Up" film. I had no school so I did an art challenge. I drew and painted to stay happy. This is when the house goes up in the sky, just before it goes on fire. I used crayons.

**Mary**: We chatted about films: they day's art challenge was about favourite films. Liam memorises the dialogue of favourite parts of films and likes to incorporate this (*"Get away from my bird!"*).

### Self Portrait, 2020

**Liam**: This is a picture of me being happy. I thought yellow was a good colour It's like the simpsons. I used coloured pencils.

**Mary**: I set up a mirror for Liam so he could see himself. He was happy with the result. He captures his smile really well.

### My Glasses, 2021

*Top: detail of glasses drawing; bottom: full piece.*

**Liam**: At art class in school, we had looked at Andy Warhol. I liked his pictures.
[At home] I drew my glasses in a square, six times. I used crayons, watercolours and a sponge.

**Mary**: I assisted with measuring and marking the grid. Liam did six separate drawings of  his glasses, so each is unique. He chose stronge colours to sponge on as background.

### A Dog in a Boat with Circles, 2021

**Liam**: I like drawing circles. I made a happy dog and a stripey boat in my sketch book. I stuck the dog and the boat on the circles.

**Mary**: Liam enjoyed making lots of marks. We talked about combining pieces of work to make new work. This collage emerged.

### "Grapefruit Moon, One Star Shining", 2022

**Liam**: I made this about a Tom Waits some. It's a good tune, and I like the moon when it's full. I used tin-foil for the star.

**Mary**: We were listening to this song and chatting about the phrase "grapefruit moon". We decided it was a good idea for a painting. I helped cutting out the star.

### The Map, February 2022

*Top and middle: in-progress details; bottom: full piece.*

**Liam**: I heard about the killing in Ukraine. I wanted to know where it was. I made a map of it and all the countries around it. I found out about lots of countries and capital cities. I worked on this for weeks.

**Mary**: I helped Liam to plot the map, and research the details of the countries. We recycled paper shopping bags as the base. I love that Liam made the Black Sea black. He used up a lot of pink crayon on Russia!

### Easter Egg, 2023

*Top*

**Liam**: Mam needed help with ideas for an Easter Card class. I used a stripey page from my sketchbook to make an Easter egg in a blank card.

**Mary**: The ready-made cards were perfect to turn some of Liam's stripes into an Easter Egg.

### The Stripes, 2024

*Bottom*

**Liam**: I was practising my stripes. I used every colour in the new paint set.

**Mary**: We bought new paints, and Liam was happy to try them out. Lots of colour!
