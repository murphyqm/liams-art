I drew a magic wizard, magic glasses, and a magic dragon. I used crayons, coloured pencil, and water colour.\nMary: We chatted about the “Imagine More” title and Liam brainstormed these ideas.\n  \n{.lightbox .framed-2 fig-alt=“A pencil drawing of a brown house being carried up into the sky by a huge bunch of colourful balloons. A man stands looking up at the house, with the text”Get away from my bird!” width=50% fig-align=“center”}\n\n\nUp, 2020\nLiam: I really like the “Up” film. I had no school so I did an art challenge. I drew and painted to stay happy. This is when the house goes up in the sky, just before it goes on fire. I used crayons.\nMary: We chatted about films: they day’s art challenge was about favourite films. Liam memorises the dialogue of favourite parts of films and likes to incorporate this (“Get away from my bird!”)."

I used coloured pencils.\nMary: I set up a mirror for Liam so he could see himself. He was happy with the result. He captures his smile really well.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Glasses, 2021\nTop: detail of glasses drawing; bottom: full piece.\nLiam: At art class in school, we had looked at Andy Warhol. I liked his pictures. [At home] I drew my glasses in a square, six times. I used crayons, watercolours and a sponge.\nMary: I assisted with measuring and marking the grid. Liam did six separate drawings of his glasses, so each is unique. He chose stronge colours to sponge on as background."

I stuck the dog and the boat on the circles.\nMary: Liam enjoyed making lots of marks. We talked about combining pieces of work to make new work. This collage emerged.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Grapefruit Moon, One Star Shining”, 2022\nLiam: I made this about a Tom Waits some. It’s a good tune, and I like the moon when it’s full. I used tin-foil for the star.\nMary: We were listening to this song and chatting about the phrase “grapefruit moon”. We decided it was a good idea for a painting. I helped cutting out the star.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Map, February 2022\nTop and middle: in-progress details; bottom: full piece.\nLiam: I heard about the killing in Ukraine. I wanted to know where it was. I made a map of it and all the countries around it. I found out about lots of countries and capital cities. I worked on this for weeks.\nMary: I helped Liam to plot the map, and research the details of the countries. We recycled paper shopping bags as the base. I love that Liam made the Black Sea black. He used up a lot of pink crayon on Russia!"
